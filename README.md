/**
   #Welcome to Caeser Cipher program
 * This program is designed to perform encryption and decryption operations using a shift cipher.
 * 
 * The program starts by calling the main() function. If the user chooses to quit, the program ends.
 * Otherwise, it asks for the mode (encryption or decryption), the shift value, and the message or filename.
 * 
 * If the user chooses to process a message, it prints the processed message.
 * If the user chooses to process a file, it writes the processed messages to a file named 'results.txt'.
